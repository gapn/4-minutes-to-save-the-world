# 4 Minutes to Save the World üéÆ

**Game Jam:** Tiny but Mighty (FreeCodeCamp, August 2025)
**Theme:** Small but impactful and meaningful

---

## Concept

Player must run through 3 labyrinths in 4 minutes.

- Timer starts at 4:00.
- Only reaching checkpoints in time adds bonus seconds (max 5:00 total).
- Some dead ends contain meaningful messages the player can save.

---

## How to Play

Your goal is to navigate through three challenging mazes before the 4-minute timer expires. On each level, you can collect 5 educational messages to understand how to help the world. Look for checkpoints to gain extra time, but be quick ‚Äî humanity is counting on you!
