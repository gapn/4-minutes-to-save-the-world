- Smooth animated player movement

---

## Tech

- HTML `<canvas>` for maze & player
- CSS for layout + overlays
- JavaScript for core game logic

---

## Progress üöÄ

- ‚úÖ Initial skeleton (HTML, CSS, JS, README, .gitignore)
- ‚úÖ Maze layout rendering on canvas
- ‚úÖ Implement player movement with smooth animation
- ‚è≥ Next: Add interactive tiles (messages, checkpoint, finish tile)
